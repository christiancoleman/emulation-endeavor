# Chip8MyHomework
Semi-finished project in that a few roms work pretty well. Great learning experience in interpretting an old harware platform while directly working with bitwise operations and system-specific opcodes. Also, I use my own very simplified version of **unit testing** in tests.c.

I used C and SDL.

# Chip8MyHomeworkCpp
This was going to be the same as Chip8MyHomework but implemented in C++. I may come back to this but right now this is just a shell/sandbox for me to toy around with the idea. If you see commits there then I've started to implement it more and more. It would be nice to have a more structured and OOP version of the C version.

# Chip8MyHomeworkQtFrontEnd
This was going to be a Qt frontend for the C++ and C implementations of the CHIP-8 system. I decided to use SDL instead but may come back to this to delve more into Qt. I think I learned that a C integration with Qt would be beyond the scope of what I'd like to do.
